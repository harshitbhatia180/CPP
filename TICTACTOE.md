The merge sort algorithm is an implementation of the divide and conquer technique. It consists of mainly 3 steps:
1. Divide: In this step, the array/list keeps dividing itself recursively into sub-arrays until it reaches the base case.
•	Find the middle index of the array and divide it from the middle.

2. Recursively solve: In this step, the sub-arrays are sorted using recursion.
•	Call merge sort for the first half of the array.
•	Call merge sort for the second half of the array

3. Combine: Lastly, this step makes use of the merge( ) function to combine the sub-arrays into the final sorted array.
